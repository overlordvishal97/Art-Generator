# Art-Generator
This project generates a piece of art inspired by a known artist using a combination of colors extracted from an image. The art is created using the Turtle graphics library in Python

# Requirements
Python 3.x
Turtle graphics library
Colorgram package (not available on Repl.it, see note)

# Note
This code will not work on Repl.it as it requires the Colorgram package, which is not available on the platform. Please see the video tutorials for more information on how to set up and run this project.

# How it Works
The code extracts a list of RGB colors from an image file (image.jpg) using the Colorgram package.
The Turtle graphics library is used to create a canvas and a turtle object.
The turtle object is set up to draw dots of random colors from the extracted list.
The dots are drawn in a pattern to create a piece of art.
The final art piece is displayed on the screen.

# Customization
You can customize the art piece by:
Changing the image file used to extract colors
Adjusting the number of dots and the spacing between them
Experimenting with different turtle graphics settings
